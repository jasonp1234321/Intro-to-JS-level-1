                In the world of programming, there was some conflict. The burden of grouping text 
                was left to the <span>monkeys</span> whose skills in such areas were so lacking that 
                they could do no more than press the <b><i>Enter</b></i> key over and over again.
            </p>
            <P>
                Then there came the <div>DIV</div> and the <span>SPAN</span>. Lo these mighty tags 
                brought peace to the realm and the <span>monkeys</span> lived happily ever after.
